   abstract = {PbS quantum dot (QD) solar cells demonstrate great potential in solar energy conversion with a broad and flexible spectral response. Even though long-term storage stabilities of QD solar cells were reported in literature, the operation stability from a more practical aspect, to date, has been not yet investigated. Herein, we observe the structure degradation process of a PbS QD-ink based solar cell during the device operation. Simultaneously to probing the solar cell parameters, the overall structure evolutions of the QDs in both, active layer and hole transport layer of the solar cell are studied with grazing-incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS/GIWAXS). We find a spontaneous decrease of the QD inter-dot distance with an increase in the spatial disorder in the active layer (PbX2-PbS QDs, X = I, and Br) during the operation induced degradation. Consequently, the structure disorder-induced broadening of the energy state distribution is responsible for the decrease in open-circuit voltage V-oc leading to the device degradation. These findings elucidate the origin of light-soaking as well as the structure degradation of QD ink-based solar cells and indicate that the stability of the device can be realized by the positional stabilization of the QDs in the QD solid.},

   abstract = {For PbS quantum dot (QD)-based optoelectronic devices, gold is the most frequently used electrode material. In most device architectures, gold is in direct contact with the QD solid. To better understand the formation of the interface between gold and a close-packed QD layer at an early stage, in situ grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering is used to observe the gold sputter deposition on a 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT)-treated PbS QD solid. In the kinetics of gold layer growth, the forming and merging of small gold clusters (radius less than 1.6 nm) are observed at the early stages. The thereby formed medium gold clusters (radius between 1.9-2.4 nm) are influenced by the QDs' templating effect. Furthermore, simulations suggest that the medium gold clusters grow preferably along the QDs' boundaries rather than as a top coating of the QDs. When the thickness of the sputtered gold layer reaches 6.25 nm, larger gold clusters with a radius of 5.3 nm form. Simultaneously, a percolation layer with a thickness of 2.5 nm is established underneath the gold clusters. This fundamental understanding of the QD-gold interface formation will help to control the implementation of sputtered gold electrodes on close-packed QD solids in device manufacturing processes.},

   abstract = {Colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for various optoelectronic applications based on solution-processed thin-film techniques. In this work, a versatile layer-by-layer (LBL) spray deposition of the QDs is introduced aiming for a future large-scale fabrication process of optoelectronic devices. As compared to spin coated QD solids, a smaller inter-dot distance and a better-ordered superlattice stacking behavior of the QDs are found in the spray-deposited QD solids as confirmed by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The spectral mapping combined time-resolved photoluminescence analysis indicates a longer charge carrier lifetime and better order of the energy state distribution of the spray-deposited QD solid comparing with the spin coated one. Thus, photodetectors based on spray deposition of QD solids demonstrate an excellent device performance, with the responsivity achieving 365.1 A/W and the detectivity reaching up to 1.4 x 10(12) Jones under an illumination power of 63.5 mu W/cm(2) at a wavelength of 1250 nm. The spray-deposited device performances indicate a great potential of spray deposition of large sized QDs in large-scale fabrications for optoelectronics using longer wavelengths.},

   abstract = {Colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs) are attractive for solution-processed thin-film optoelectronic applications. In particular, directly achieving QD thin-films by printing is a very promising method for low-cost and large-scale fabrication. The kinetics of QD particles during the deposition process play an important role in the QD film quality and their respective optoelectronic performance. In this work, the particle self-organization behavior of small-sized QDs with an average diameter of 2.88 +/- 0.36 nm is investigated for the first time in situ during printing by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The time-dependent changes in peak intensities suggest that the structure formation and phase transition of QD films happen within 30 seconds. The stacking of QDs is initialized by a templating effect, and a face-centered cubic (FCC) film forms in which a superlattice distortion is also found. A body-centered cubic nested FCC stacking is the final QD assembly layout. The small size of the inorganic QDs and the ligand collapse during the solvent evaporation can well explain this stacking behavior. These results provide important fundamental understanding of structure formation of small-sized QD based films prepared via large-scale deposition with printing with a slot die coater.},

   abstract = {Improving the stability of inkjet-printed quantum dot light emitting diodes (QLEDs) is critical for the technology to become commercially viable. The major obstacle is the compromise between the printability of the ink system and the functionality of the carrier transport layers. Here, a ternary ink system consisting of octane, 1-cyclohexyl-ethanol, and n-butyl acetate is reported, which solves the erosion between the printed quantum dot ink and the underneath hole transport layer. A gradient vacuum post-treatment is developed to accompany the ternary ink system with gradient vacuum pressures, which is helpful in forming a uniform printing layer. Based on both technologies, the inkjet-printed R/G/B QLEDS are fabricated with high resolution patterns, showing high efficiencies and stabilities. The external quantum efficiency of R/G/B devices is 19.3%, 18.0%, and 4.4%, respectively. Correspondingly, the half operating lifetime is up to 25 178 h @ 1000 cd m(-2), 20 655 h @ 1000 cd m(-2), and 46 h @ 100 cd m(-2), respectively. The improvements in the ink engineering and post-treatment in this study have taken the efficiency and stability of the devices to a higher level and confirm the application prospects of printed QLEDs in the display industry.},

   abstract = {Infrared (IR) solar cells are promising devices for significantly improving the power conversion efficiency of common solar cells by harvesting the low-energy IR photons. PbSe quantum dots (QDs) are superior IR photon absorbing materials due to their strong quantum confinement and thus strong interdot electronic coupling. However, the high chemical activity of PbSe QDs leads to etching and poor passivation in ligand exchange, resulting in a high trap-state density and a high open circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Here we develop a hybrid ligand co-passivation strategy to simultaneously passivate the Pb and Se sites; that is, halide anions passivate the Pb sites and Cd cations passivate the Se sites. The cation and anion hybrid passivation substantially improves the quality of PbSe QD solids, giving rise to an excellent trap-state control and prolonged carrier lifetime. A high VOC and a high short circuit current density (JSC) are achieved simultaneously in the IR QD solar cells based on this hybrid ligand treatment. Finally, a IR-PCE of 1.31% under the 1100-nm-filtered solar illumination is achieved in the PbSe QD solar cells, which is the highest IR-PCE for PbSe QD IR solar cells at present. Additionally, the PbSe QD devices show a high external quantum efficiency of 80% at ∼1295 nm.},

The obtained CQD inks show the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of approximately 10%. As a result, a high V(oc) of 0.71 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest V(oc) loss (0.35 eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE >10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells. This work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct-synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.},

   abstract = {Smart contact lenses have been put forward for years, but there is still no commercial product in the market; the high cost due to expensive fabrication techniques could be one of the reasons. In this paper, first, a cost-efficient and reliable route to fabricate graphene grating on contact lens was designed and demonstrated based on the direct laser interference patterning graphene film on commercial contact lenses using an Nd:YAG laser. The thickness of the film and the interference angle have been taken into consideration. Optical characterization and simulation have been applied to evaluate the quality of our final achieved grating patterns with a grating size from 0.92 to 3.04 mum. Two-dimensional (2D) patterns could also be obtained through double-time laser interference. Contact angles for samples with different interference angles were presented considering the service environment of smart contact lenses. Of course, the conductivity of the samples was evaluated using a four-probe method. The most conductive sample had the sheet resistance lower than 30 Omega/sq. This research study highlighted the possibility of patterning graphene with the laser ablation method and provided a candidate solution for the fabrication of smart contact lenses under controlled cost.},

   abstract = {Ink-jet printing is a promising deposition technology, which is capable of large-area fabrication and mask-free patterning. For ink-jet-printed quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the QDs are commonly dissolved in a mixture of solvent and thickener ink system. However, the hole transport layer could be eroded by this QD ink, leading to a rough surface morphology and resulting in the leakage of carriers and low device performance. This phenomenon was first and directly observed by using an atomic force microscope and a cross-sectional scanning electron microscope. We, therefore, redesigned the annealing process of the hole transport layer to achieve an optimized smooth surface with a reduced number of defects for ink-jet-printed QD LEDs (QLEDs). Optimized morphology brings back a maximum luminance of over 30,000 cd/m(2) and an external quantum efficiency of 7.52% for the ink-jet-printed red QLEDs using CdSe QDs, which are comparable to those of the spin-coated device. Moreover, the operation lifetime of the ink-jet-printed device is also enhanced by the restored surface morphology. An enhanced T-50 lifetime of the ink-jet-printed device at 1000 cd/m(2) is improved from 26 to 127 h, which converted to a long T-50 lifetime of 8013 h, when operated at 100 cd/m(2).},

   abstract = {Recently, lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) have demonstrated great potential in becoming one of the most promising next-generation photoelectrical materials for photodetectors. PbS QDs provide fascinating properties including size-controllable spectral sensitivity, a wide and tunable absorption range, cost-efficient solution processability, and flexible substrate compatibility. One of the key problems that limit the performance of PbS QDs-based photodetectors is inefficient carrier transfer. Long ligands decorating the outside surface of PbS QDs to protect them against degeneration inhibit the transfer of electrical charge carriers and thereby limit the device performance. To overcome this problem, the long ligands need to be effectively exchanged. Here, a two-step ligand-exchange method is demonstrated. The QDs are pretreated using methylammonium iodide in solution as the first step ligand exchange before the layer-by-layer deposition process and solid-state ligand exchange. The grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses prove a smaller spacing among the QDs and an increased ligand-exchange ratio by adopting the two-step method. This strongly indicates a better capability of charge transfer than the traditional one-step solid-state ligand-exchange technology. Devices fabricated using the two-step method present an enhancement of the charge-transfer capability with a larger current. The efficient charge transfer is further demonstrated by a significant 94% increase of the responsivity and a 57% enhancement of the detectivity of the PbS QDs-based photodetector, reaching 3302 mA/W and 5.06 x 10(12) J, respectively.},

   abstract = {The emergence of optical Internet of Things (optical-IoT) for sixth-generation (6G) networks has been envisaged to relieve the bandwidth congestion in the conventional radio frequency (RF) channel, and to support the ever-increasing number of smart devices. Among the plethora of device innovations deemed essential for fortifying the development, herein we report on the visible-to-near-infrared color-conversion luminescent-dyes based on lead sulphide quantum dots (PbS QDs), so as to achieve an eye-safe high-speed optical link. The solution-processed PbS QDs exhibited strong absorption in the visible range, radiative recombination lifetime of 6.4 $\mu$s, as well as high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 88%. Our proof-of-principle demonstration based on an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme established an infrared data transmission of 0.27 Mbit/s, readily supporting an indoor optical-IoT system, and shed light on the possibility for PbS-integrated transceivers in supporting remote access control of multiple nodes. We further envisaged that our investigations could find applications in future development of solution-processable PbS-integrated luminescent fibers, concentrators, and waveguides for high-speed optical receivers.},

   abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is an advanced and high-efficiency wireless communication technology. As one of the most important light sources in VLC, conventional white light emitting diode (WLED) based on Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce) phosphor limits the system transmitting rate severely due to its narrow modulation bandwidth. Considering the short fluorescent lifetime of quantum dots (QDs), QD-LEDs with wide modulation bandwidths were designed here to improve the transmitting rate of VLC. CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs and related luminescent microspheres (LMS) were implemented as light conversion materials for the QD-LEDs. Compared with conventional phosphor WLED, the proposed QD-LED and QD-WLED reached maximum improvement on modulation bandwidth at 74.19% and 67.75% respectively. Furthermore, mathematical modeling of smearing was analyzed to establish the relationship between fluorescent lifetime and modulation bandwidth. Our findings will provide an effective solution of white LEDs for high speed VLC. 2016 Optical Society of America.},

   abstract = {Alloyed green-emitting CdZnSeS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) demonstrate potential applications in solid-state lighting and displays owing to their various advantages, such as high color purity, light conversion efficiency, and color rendering index. However, their applications in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) are limited by their poor photostabilities on blue-emitting gallium nitride (GaN) LED chips. In this study, the effect of the specific surface area (SSA) in the coating layers on the photostabilities of QDs was investigated. SSA was adjusted by controlling the proportions of dense aluminum oxide (AlO(X)) layers and porous silica dioxide (SiO(2)) layers to fabricate QD protective layers via a catalyst-free sol-gel method. The results showed that the synthesized AlO(X) possessing the lowest SSA among the synthesis protective layers presented the best QD photostabilities on the LED chips. Moreover, they exhibited a 9.9-fold increase in the operational lifetime (T(80)) compared to that of pristine QDs. In addition, the QD-based WLED achieved an excellent display performance with a wide color gamut (115%) of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) color gamut standard. This approach offers a promising strategy for enhancing the QD photostabilities for applications in solid-state lighting and displays by coating the protective layers on the QD surface.},

   abstract = {Quantum dots (QDs) have received considerable attention in information displays owing to their high quantum yield, high colour purity and low-cost fabrication. However, light emission for ultra-thin QD films with low mass percentage of QDs still need to be improved because the blue light can directly transmit the films, leading to insufficient energy to excite the QDs. In this study, we report QD films based on a poly(zinc methacrylate) coating with alloyed green-emitting CdZnSeS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs@PZnMA) together with high refractive-index BaTiO(3) nanoparticles to enhance the scattering coefficient of the QD films. Results demonstrate a 7.5-fold increase in the absorption coefficient, 11.3-fold increase in the scattering coefficient, 8.5-fold increase in the optical density (OD) and 8.6-fold increase in the green-light emission of QD films, compared with films that have the same mass percentage of pristine QDs. This approach provides a promising strategy for developing QD optical films with high scattering and enhanced light emission for flexible displays.},

   abstract = {Quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) possess huge potential in display due to their outstanding optoelectronic performance; however, serve degradation during operation blocks their practical applications. High temperature is regarded as one of major factors causing degradation. Therefore, a systematical study on the working temperature of QLEDs is very essential and urgent for the development of high stable QLEDs. In this work, different influence factors such as the electro-optic conversion efficiency (EOCE), voltage, current density, active area, substrate size, substrate type and sample contact are discussed in detail on the working temperature of QLEDs. The research results show that the working temperature of general QLEDs under normal operation conditions is usually smaller than 75 degrees C when the ambient temperature is 25 degrees C. However, temperature of QLEDs working under extreme conditions, such as high power or small substrate size, will exceed 100 degrees C, resulting in irreversible damage to the devices. Moreover, some effective measures to reduce the working temperature are also proposed. The analysis and discussion of various influencing factors in this work will provide guidance for the design of stable QLEDs and help them work at a safer temperature.},
