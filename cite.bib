Abstract = {We report a 0.39-in. quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED)
   microdisplay with full high-definition (FHD, 1920 x 1080) resolution by
   integrating a red top-emitting QLED on a complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) backplane. By optimizing the
   microcavity structure and constructing a suitable energy-level structure
   for the QLED devices, the performance of the large-area (4.9 x 8.7 mm2)
   top-emitting device with normal structure reached 13,936 cd/m2 of
   brightness at 5-V bias with 13.3\% external quantum efficiency (EQE).
   Notably, the optimal device showed a low turn-on voltage of 1.7 V, which
   matched well the voltage output of the CMOS backplane. Our work
   demonstrates the great promise of QLED microdisplays for applications in
   head-mounted augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR).
   To improve the performance of top-emitting QLEDs, the optical
   architecture of device was optimized by simulation and experiment. The
   normal structured QLED performed better to match the output voltage of
   CMOS compared to the inverted device. A 0.39-in. QLED microdisplay with
   FHD (1920 x 1080) resolution was fabricated by integrating a red TEQLED
   on a CMOS backplane.image},

Abstract = {Colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs) have attracted tremendous attention in
   near-infrared photodetection for their superior optoelectronic
   properties. However, appropriate fabrication methods remain a challenge
   for scalable and high performance PbS QD photodetectors. Herein, a
   flexible microcomb printing (FMCP) technique is first introduced to
   fabricate PbS QD photoconductors without a layer-by-layer ligand
   exchange technique, and the detectors demonstrate a responsivity of 2.1
   A W-1. A computational fluid dynamics model is built to simulate the
   flow field distribution and analyze the relationship between the key
   parameters of FMCP and QD film morphology. The QD ink flow field at the
   tip of the microcomb exhibits high shear rates that lead to a better
   crystallization configuration for solid QD films formation, which is
   verified by Grazing-incidence small and wide-angle X-ray scattering.
   Moreover, the relationship between the intrinsic nature of the QD ink
   (viscosity and surface tension), substrate temperature, and printing
   speed are systematically analyzed to experimentally achieve high
   performance QD films. Benefiting from the good crystallization
   configuration, FMCP-printed photodetectors using the direct PbS QD ink
   without ligand exchange show high responsivities. The results indicate
   that FMCP is a promising method for scalable and high-performance PbS QD
   photodetectors.},

Abstract = {Developing in situ-grown perovskite single-crystal thin films (PeSCTFs)
   on transport layers is essential to achieve high-perfor-mance
   optoelectronic devices. However, it remains a challenge to grow PeSCTFs
   in situ with a high area-to-thickness ratio and low trap density. Here,
   we propose a new strategy of gradient heating nucleation and
   room-temperature growth. Gradient heating nucle-ation helps to overcome
   the high nucleation energy barrier and reduce the number of crystal
   nuclei, and room-temperature growth helps reduce the crystal growth rate
   and aims at an orderly deposi-tion and diffusion of atoms for in situ
   growth of PeSCTFs with high quality. Consequently, the fabricated
   FAPbBr3 PeSCTF achieves a record area-to-thickness ratio of 1.84 3 105
   mm and a low trap den-sity of 3.76 3 108 cm -3. Moreover, the proposed
   strategy is also shown to be a universal method for in situ growth of
   other kinds of PeSCTFs on multiple transport layers.},

Title = {Merging Passivation in Synthesis Enabling the Lowest Open-Circuit
   Voltage Loss for PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Month = {2023 FEB},
Abstract = {The high open-circuit voltage (V-oc) loss arising from insufficient
   surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of
   current lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) solar cell. Here,
   synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of
   conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well
   coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically
   optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly
   delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower
   surface trap density and beneficial doping behavior compared to the
   control sample. The obtained CQD inks show the highest photoluminescence
   quantum yield (PLQY) of 24\% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is
   more than twice the reported average PLQY value of approximate to 10\%.
   As a result, a high V-oc of 0.71 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE)
   of 13.3\% is achieved, which results in the lowest V-oc loss (0.35 eV)
   for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE >10\%, comparable to that
   of perovskite solar cells. This work provides valuable insights into the
   future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great
   potential for the direct-synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.},

Abstract = {We present dC/dV analysis based on the capacitance-voltage (C-V)
   measurement of quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs), and find that
   some key device operating parameters (electrical and optical turn-on
   voltage, peak capacitance, maximum efficiency) can be directly related
   to the turning points and maximum/minimum of the dC/dV (versus voltage)
   curve. By the dC/dV study, the behaviors such as low turn-on voltage,
   simultaneous electrical and optical turn-on process, and carrier
   accumulation during the device aging can be well explained. Moreover, we
   perform the C-V and dC/dV measurement of aged devices, and confirm that
   our dC/dV analysis is correct for them. Thus, our dC/dV analysis method
   can be applied universally for QLED devices. It provides an in-depth
   understanding of carrier dynamics in QLEDs through simple C-V
   measurement.},

Abstract = {Quantum dots (QDs) have attracted much attention as one of the most
   promising candidates for next-generation display materials. However,
   stability is still a big challenge for QDs. Herein, we encapsulated QDs
   in a thermoplastic polypropylene (PP) matrix by thermal processing
   technology to prepare a stabler color conversion film for the first
   time. Thermal processing technology expands the packaging materials of
   QDs from traditional soluble polymers to thermoplastic polymers such as
   PP with easy processing and a low cost. We showed that the QDs in the PP
   film exhibited longerlasting stability than the traditional PMMA film.
   After 216 h of blue light accelerated aging test, the QDs maintained
   more than 90\% of the initial performance in the PP film but dropped to
   less than 25\% in the PMMA film. Moreover, the reasons for the improved
   stability have been further discussed. It was found that the PP-H film
   not only possessed better barriers to moisture and oxygen, but the
   absence of ester groups also led to a milder environment around the QDs.
   The results show that ester groups have stronger electronegativity and
   easily cause the ligands on the surface of QDs to fall off, which lead
   to performance degradation.},

Title = {Tunable Infrared Sensing Properties of MXenes Enabled by Intercalants},
Journal = {ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {2022 SEP},
Abstract = {Light interaction physical properties of MXenes are fundamentally
   important and promising for developing new broadband photodetection
   applications. In this work, the significant influence of intercalants on
   the photo-electronic properties of MXenes is studied. It is found that
   the intercalated H2O-induced inter-flake resistance greatly restricts
   the photon excitation responsivity of Ti3C2Tx, resulting in a slow and
   irreversible resistance change under laser irradiation. After
   deintercalation of H2O by in situ laser writing, the resistance of
   Ti3C2Tx responds fast and reversibly to laser excitation and the
   variation range is proportional to laser power. By extending the
   findings to another MXene member, Mo2TiC2, the intercalant induced
   resistance is successfully developed for optoelectronic detection. By
   selectively deintercalating H2O in the as-prepared Mo2TiC2 which is
   co-intercalated by H2O and TMAOH, bare TMAOH intercalated Mo2TiC2 shows
   fast and reversible resistance changes with laser. Moreover, the
   resistance of bare TMAOH intercalated Mo2TiC2 shows a negative
   temperature coefficient behavior while the fully deintercalated Ti3C2Tx
   shows a positive temperature behavior. These findings elucidate the
   understanding of the optoelectronic properties of MXenes and provide
   insights into the engineering of interfacial chemistry of MXenes for
   performance enhancement toward various detectors/sensors beyond
   optoelectronic applications.},

Abstract = {Conjugated polymers have been explored as promising hole-transporting
   layer (HTL) in lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dot (QD) solar cells. The fine
   regulation of the inorganic/organic interface is pivotal to realize high
   device performance. In this work, we propose using CsPbl(3) QDs as the
   interfacial layer between PbS QD active layer and organic polymer HTL.
   The relative soft perovskite can mediate the interface and form
   favorable energy level alignment, improving charge extraction and
   reducing interfacial charge recombination. As a result, the photovoltaic
   performance can be efficiently improved from 10.50\% to 12.32\%. This
   work may provide new guidelines to the device structural design of QD
   optoelectronics by integrating different solution-processed
   semiconductors.},

   for QLED in the display application. In the work, we studied patterning
   thin film to form IGZO electron transport layers for QLED. Making use of
   a staggered IGZO film as the electron transport layer, we studied QLED
   degradation and observed luminance inversion, which is due to the
   non-uniform current spreading effect caused by the staggered IGZO film.
   The current crowding at the thinner film area (with lower electric
   resistance) leads to a patterned emission of the device but also a
   faster device degradation at the same time.},

Abstract = {Inkjet printing as an effective patterning deposition technology is very
   suitable for the fabrication of quantum dot light-emitting diodes in
   next-generation displays. However, there are still many challenges in
   achieving high efficiency and stability of the printed device. Herein,
   we reported the inkjet-printed quantum dot light-emitting diodes with an
   external quantum efficiency of over 20\% and half lifetime at 1000
   cd/m(2) of 27,000 h for the first time. Such excellent performance is
   owing to the successfully optimal thickness (seven monolayers) of the
   extra ZnS shell, which improves the balance of the carries injection to
   suppress the nonradiative process for inkjet-printed devices. Overall,
   this performance from inkjet-printed quantum dot light-emitting diodes
   accelerates the printed device to meet the requirements of practical
   display and lighting applications.},

Abstract = {Luminescent inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) are promising in
   various optical applications, particularly in advanced lighting and
   displays. The instability of PeNCs and PeNC composites from different
   aspects hinder their practical applications. Many previous methods
   indicate that an intact and facile wrapping strategy could effectively
   address this challenge. In this work, we introduce an in situ ligand
   polymerization (ILP) method for the fabrication of PeNC composites. By
   introducing (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) as the initial ligand
   of the PeNCs directly and polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) as the monomer
   to form the polymerized matrix, a polymerized and hydrophobic SiO2
   matrix structure is formed, which intrinsically protects the PeNCs
   against moisture-induced deterioration. The stability test indicates
   that the ILP composite powders demonstrate an improved stability against
   various solvent conditions and light exposure compared to the
   conventional PeNCs-SiO2 composite. More importantly, the ILP composite
   exhibits an excellent compatibility with the acrylate solvent which is
   widely used for light-solidification in light converting film
   fabrication. The ILP composite film demonstrates an ultrastable
   operational performance in our standard test outperforming the
   conventional PeNCs-SiO2 composite configuration. Thus, the ILP composite
   demonstrates great potential for use in advanced lighting and displays.},

Abstract = {Improving the stability of inkjet-printed quantum dot light emitting
   diodes (QLEDs) is critical for the technology to become commercially
   viable. The major obstacle is the compromise between the printability of
   the ink system and the functionality of the carrier transport layers.
   Here, a ternary ink system consisting of octane, 1-cyclohexyl-ethanol,
   and n-butyl acetate is reported, which solves the erosion between the
   printed quantum dot ink and the underneath hole transport layer. A
   gradient vacuum post-treatment is developed to accompany the ternary ink
   system with gradient vacuum pressures, which is helpful in forming a
   uniform printing layer. Based on both technologies, the inkjet-printed
   R/G/B QLEDS are fabricated with high resolution patterns, showing high
   efficiencies and stabilities. The external quantum efficiency of R/G/B
   devices is 19.3\%, 18.0\%, and 4.4\%, respectively. Correspondingly, the
   half operating lifetime is up to 25 178 h @ 1000 cd m(-2), 20 655 h @
   1000 cd m(-2), and 46 h @ 100 cd m(-2), respectively. The improvements
   in the ink engineering and post-treatment in this study have taken the
   efficiency and stability of the devices to a higher level and confirm
   the application prospects of printed QLEDs in the display industry.},

Title = {Universal Strategy for Improving Perovskite Photodiode Performance:
   Interfacial Built-In Electric Field Manipulated by Unintentional Doping},
Journal = {ADVANCED SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Organic-inorganic halide perovskites have demonstrated significant light
   detection potential, with a performance comparable to that of
   commercially available photodetectors. In this study, a general design
   guideline, which is applicable to both inverted and regular structures,
   is proposed for high-performance perovskite photodiodes through an
   interfacial built-in electric field (E) for efficient carrier separation
   and transport. The interfacial E generated at the interface between the
   active and charge transport layers far from the incident light is
   critical for effective charge carrier collection. The interfacial E can
   be modulated by unintentional doping of the perovskite, whose doping
   type and density can be easily controlled by the post-annealing time and
   temperature. Employing the proposed design guideline, the inverted and
   regular perovskite photodiodes exhibit the external quantum efficiency
   of 83.51\% and 76.5\% and responsivities of 0.37 and 0.34 A W-1,
   respectively. In the self-powered mode, the dark currents reach 7.95 x
   10(-11) and 1.47 x 10(-8) A cm(-2), providing high detectivities of 7.34
   X 10(13) and 4.96 x 10(12) Jones, for inverted and regular structures,
   respectively, and a long-term stability of at least 1600 h. This
   optimization strategy is compatible with existing materials and device
   structures and hence leads to substantial potential applications in
   perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.},

Abstract = {Alloyed green-emitting CdZnSeS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) demonstrate
   potential applications in solid-state lighting and displays owing to
   their various advantages, such as high color purity, light conversion
   efficiency, and color rendering index. However, their applications in
   white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) are limited by their poor
   photostabilities on blue-emitting gallium nitride (GaN) LED chips. In
   this study, the effect of the specific surface area (SSA) in the coating
   layers on the photostabilities of QDs was investigated. SSA was adjusted
   by controlling the proportions of dense aluminum oxide (AlOX) layers and
   porous silica dioxide (SiO2) layers to fabricate QD protective layers
   via a catalyst-free sol-gel method. The results showed that the
   synthesized AlOX possessing the lowest SSA among the synthesis
   protective layers presented the best QD photostabilities on the LED
   chips. Moreover, they exhibited a 9.9-fold increase in the operational
   lifetime (T-80) compared to that of pristine QDs. In addition, the
   QD-based WLED achieved an excellent display performance with a wide
   color gamut (115\%) of the National Television System Committee (NTSC)
   color gamut standard. This approach offers a promising strategy for
   enhancing the QD photostabilities for applications in solid-state
   lighting and displays by coating the protective layers on the QD
   surface.},

Abstract = {Ink-jet printing is a promising deposition technology, which is capable
   of large-area fabrication and mask-free patterning. For ink-jet-printed
   quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the QDs are commonly
   dissolved in a mixture of solvent and thickener ink system. However, the
   hole transport layer could be eroded by this QD ink, leading to a rough
   surface morphology and resulting in the leakage of carriers and low
   device performance. This phenomenon was first and directly observed by
   using an atomic force microscope and a cross-sectional scanning electron
   microscope. We, therefore, redesigned the annealing process of the hole
   transport layer to achieve an optimized smooth surface with a reduced
   number of defects for ink-jet-printed QD LEDs (QLEDs). Optimized
   morphology brings back a maximum luminance of over 30,000 cd/m(2) and an
   external quantum efficiency of 7.52\% for the ink-jet-printed red QLEDs
   using CdSe QDs, which are comparable to those of the spin-coated device.
   Moreover, the operation lifetime of the ink-jet-printed device is also
   enhanced by the restored surface morphology. An enhanced T-50 lifetime
   of the ink-jet-printed device at 1000 cd/m(2) is improved from 26 to 127
   h, which converted to a long T-50 lifetime of 8013 h, when operated at
   100 cd/m(2).},

Abstract = {PbS quantum dot (QD) solar cells demonstrate great potential in solar
   energy conversion with a broad and flexible spectral response. Even
   though long-term storage stabilities of QD solar cells were reported in
   literature, the operation stability from a more practical aspect, to
   date, has been not yet investigated. Herein, we observe the structure
   degradation process of a PbS QD-ink based solar cell during the device
   operation. Simultaneously to probing the solar cell parameters, the
   overall structure evolutions of the QDs in both, active layer and hole
   transport layer of the solar cell are studied with grazing-incidence
   small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS/GIWAXS). We find a
   spontaneous decrease of the QD inter-dot distance with an increase in
   the spatial disorder in the active layer (PbX2-PbS QDs, X = I, and Br)
   during the operation induced degradation. Consequently, the structure
   disorder-induced broadening of the energy state distribution is
   responsible for the decrease in open-circuit voltage V-oc leading to the
   device degradation. These findings elucidate the origin of light-soaking
   as well as the structure degradation of QD ink-based solar cells and
   indicate that the stability of the device can be realized by the
   positional stabilization of the QDs in the QD solid.},

Abstract = {Infrared (IR) solar cells are promising devices for significantly
   improving the power conversion efficiency of common solar cells by
   harvesting the low-energy IR photons. PbSe quantum dots (QDs) are
   superior IR photon absorbing materials due to their strong quantum
   confinement and thus strong interdot electronic coupling. However, the
   high chemical activity of PbSe QDs leads to etching and poor passivation
   in ligand exchange, resulting in a high trap-state density and a high
   open circuit voltage (V-OC) deficit. Here we develop a hybrid ligand
   co-passivation strategy to simultaneously passivate the Pb and Se sites;
   that is, halide anions passivate the Pb sites and Cd cations passivate
   the Se sites. The cation and anion hybrid passivation substantially
   improves the quality of PbSe QD solids, giving rise to an excellent
   trap-state control and prolonged carrier lifetime. A high V-OC and a
   high short circuit current density (J(SC)) are achieved simultaneously
   in the IR QD solar cells based on this hybrid ligand treatment. Finally,
   a IR-PCE of 1.31\% under the 1100-nm-filtered solar illumination is
   achieved in the PbSe QD solar cells, which is the highest IR-PCE for
   PbSe QD IR solar cells at present. Additionally, the PbSe QD devices
   show a high external quantum efficiency of 80\% at similar to 1295 nm.},

Abstract = {Colloidal nanoplatelets (NPLs) are an emerging semiconductor nanocrystal
   in the display community due to their ultranarrow emission linewidth.
   Herein, an ultrapure green emitting nanocrystal light-emitting diode
   (LED) based on four-monolayer CdSe/CdS core/crown NPLs is developed. By
   applying the nonstacked nanoplates, the nonradiative energy transfer in
   the NPLs film is successfully suppressed. The nonstacked NPL-LEDs with
   pure green emission of 521.5 nm exhibit a low turn-on voltage of 2.1 V,
   a maximum luminance of 22 400 cd m(-2), a peak external quantum
   efficiency (EQE) of 2.16\%, which is a sixfold enhancement comparing to
   the stacked NPL-LED (EQE = 0.34\%). This work demonstrates the potential
   of core/crown NPLs for ultrawide color gamut displays.},

Abstract = {Lead chalcogenide quantum dot (QD) infrared (IR) solar cells are
   promising devices for breaking through the theoretical efficiency limit
   of single-junction solar cells by harvesting the low-energy IR photons
   that cannot be utilized by common devices. However, the device
   performance of QD IR photovoltaic is limited by the restrictive relation
   between open-circuit voltages (V-OC) and short circuit current densities
   (J(SC)), caused by the contradiction between surface passivation and
   electronic coupling of QD solids. Here, a strategy is developed to
   decouple this restriction via epitaxially coating a thin PbS shell over
   the PbSe QDs (PbSe/PbS QDs) combined with in situ halide passivation.
   The strong electronic coupling from the PbSe core gives rise to
   significant carrier delocalization, which guarantees effective carrier
   transport. Benefited from the protection of PbS shell and in situ halide
   passivation, excellent trap-state control of QDs is eventually achieved
   after the ligand exchange. By a fine control of the PbS shell thickness,
   outstanding IR J(SC) of 6.38 mA cm(-2) and IR V-OC of 0.347 V are
   simultaneously achieved under the 1100 nm-filtered solar illumination,
   providing a new route to unfreeze the trade-off between V-OC and J(SC)
   limited by the photoactive layer with a given bandgap.},

Abstract = {Colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for various
   optoelectronic applications based on solution-processed thin-film
   techniques. In this work, a versatile layer-by-layer (LBL) spray
   deposition of the QDs is introduced aiming for a future large-scale
   fabrication process of optoelectronic devices. As compared to spin
   coated QD solids, a smaller inter-dot distance and a better-ordered
   superlattice stacking behavior of the QDs are found in the
   spray-deposited QD solids as confirmed by grazing-incidence small-angle
   X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The spectral mapping combined time-resolved
   photoluminescence analysis indicates a longer charge carrier lifetime
   and better order of the energy state distribution of the spray-deposited
   QD solid comparing with the spin coated one. Thus, photodetectors based
   on spray deposition of QD solids demonstrate an excellent device
   performance, with the responsivity achieving 365.1 A/W and the
   detectivity reaching up to 1.4 x 10(12) Jones under an illumination
   power of 63.5 mu W/cm(2) at a wavelength of 1250 nm. The spray-deposited
   device performances indicate a great potential of spray deposition of
   large sized QDs in large-scale fabrications for optoelectronics using
   longer wavelengths.},

Abstract = {Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells have gained increasing
   attention in the past few years. In this work, active layers of a
   wide-bandgap polymer donor with benzodithiophene units PBDB-T-2F and a
   non-fullerene small molecule acceptor IT-M are assembled into
   photovoltaic devices with different amounts of solvent additive
   1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The influence of DIO on the nanoscale film
   morphology and crystalline structure as well as the charge carrier
   dynamics of the active layers are investigated by combining
   grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS),
   grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), X-ray
   reflectivity (XRR), UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL)
   and space charge limited current measurements, which are correlated with
   the corresponding performance of the solar cells. At 0.5 vol\% DIO
   addition, the wide-bandgap non-fullerene organic solar cells show the
   best performance due to high open-circuit voltage and short-circuit
   current resulting from an improved charge carrier management due to the
   optimal inner nanoscale morphology of the active layers in terms of
   surface enrichment, crystallinity and crystalline orientation.},

Abstract = {Quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) possess huge potential in
   display due to their outstanding optoelectronic performance; however,
   serve degradation during operation blocks their practical applications.
   High temperature is regarded as one of major factors causing
   degradation. Therefore, a systematical study on the working temperature
   of QLEDs is very essential and urgent for the development of high stable
   QLEDs. In this work, different influence factors such as the
   electro-optic conversion efficiency (EOCE), voltage, current density,
   active area, substrate size, substrate type and sample contact are
   discussed in detail on the working temperature of QLEDs. The research
   results show that the working temperature of general QLEDs under normal
   operation conditions is usually smaller than 75 degrees C when the
   ambient temperature is 25 degrees C. However, temperature of QLEDs
   working under extreme conditions, such as high power or small substrate
   size, will exceed 100 degrees C, resulting in irreversible damage to the
   devices. Moreover, some effective measures to reduce the working
   temperature are also proposed. The analysis and discussion of various
   influencing factors in this work will provide guidance for the design of
   stable QLEDs and help them work at a safer temperature. (C) 2020 Optical

Abstract = {For PbS quantum dot (QD)-based optoelectronic devices, gold is the most
   frequently used electrode material. In most device architectures, gold
   is in direct contact with the QD solid. To better understand the
   formation of the interface between gold and a close-packed QD layer at
   an early stage, in situ grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering
   is used to observe the gold sputter deposition on a 1,2-ethanedithiol
   (EDT)-treated PbS QD solid. In the kinetics of gold layer growth, the
   forming and merging of small gold clusters (radius less than 1.6 nm) are
   observed at the early stages. The thereby formed medium gold clusters
   (radius between 1.9-2.4 nm) are influenced by the QDs' templating
   effect. Furthermore, simulations suggest that the medium gold clusters
   grow preferably along the QDs' boundaries rather than as a top coating
   of the QDs. When the thickness of the sputtered gold layer reaches 6.25
   nm, larger gold clusters with a radius of 5.3 nm form. Simultaneously, a
   percolation layer with a thickness of 2.5 nm is established underneath
   the gold clusters. This fundamental understanding of the QD-gold
   interface formation will help to control the implementation of sputtered
   gold electrodes on close-packed QD solids in device manufacturing
   processes.},

Title = {Impact of the resistive switching effects in ZnMgO electron transport

Abstract = {The phenomenon of positive aging has been frequently reported in quantum
   dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). However, the root cause for this
   phenomenon remains illusive. On the other hand, the commonly used
   electron transport material in QLEDs, ZnMgO, has been extensively
   studied as a resistive switching material. In this work, we found that
   the ZnMgO nano-particle film used in QLEDs showed a clear resistive
   switching effect. It is, thus, reasonable to relate the resistive
   switching mechanism of ZnMgO to the aging characteristics of QLED
   devices. We found that during the first stage of QLED aging, the
   efficiency of the QLED was improved due to the migration of off-lattice
   ions and formation of conductive filaments in the ZnMgO layer.
   Subsequently, as active oxygen ions migrated to the interface between
   quantum dots and ZnMgO, the barrier for electron transport increased due
   to the oxidation of quantum dots. At the same time, the conductive
   filaments were gradually fused due to the continuous external electric
   field. As a result, the performance of QLED devices continuously
   deteriorated.},

Abstract = {Quantum dots (QDs) have received considerable attention in information
   displays owing to their high quantum yield, high colour purity and
   low-cost fabrication. However, light emission for ultra-thin QD films
   with low mass percentage of QDs still need to be improved because the
   blue light can directly transmit the films, leading to insufficient
   energy to excite the QDs. In this study, we report QD films based on a
   poly(zinc methacrylate) coating with alloyed green-emitting CdZnSeS/ZnS
   quantum dots (QDs@PZnMA) together with high refractive-index
   BaTiO(3)nanoparticles to enhance the scattering coefficient of the QD
   films. Results demonstrate a 7.5-fold increase in the absorption
   coefficient, 11.3-fold increase in the scattering coefficient, 8.5-fold
   increase in the optical density (OD) and 8.6-fold increase in the
   green-light emission of QD films, compared with films that have the same
   mass percentage of pristine QDs. This approach provides a promising
   strategy for developing QD optical films with high scattering and
   enhanced light emission for flexible displays.},

Title = {Facet Control for Trap-State Suppression in Colloidal Quantum Dot Solids},
Journal = {ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {22},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Trap states in colloidal quantum dot (QD) solids significantly affect
   the performance of QD solar cells, because they limit the open-circuit
   voltage and short circuit current. The \{100\} facets of PbS QDs are
   important origins of trap states due to their weak or missing
   passivation. However, previous investigations focused on synthesis,
   ligand exchange, or passivation approaches and ignored the control of
   \{100\} facets for a given dot size. Herein, trap states are suppressed
   from the source via facet control of PbS QDs. The \{100\} facets of
   approximate to 3 nm PbS QDs are minimized by tuning the balance between
   the growth kinetics and thermodynamics in the synthesis. The PbS QDs
   synthesized at a relatively low temperature with a high oversaturation
   follow a kinetics-dominated growth, producing nearly octahedral
   nanoparticles terminated mostly by \{111\} facets. In contrast, the PbS
   QDs synthesized at a relatively high temperature follow a
   thermodynamics-dominated growth. Thus, a spherical shape is preferred,
   producing truncated octahedral nanoparticles with more \{100\} facets.
   Compared to PbS QDs from thermodynamics-dominated growth, the PbS QDs
   with less \{100\} facets show fewer trap states in the QD solids,
   leading to a better photovoltaic device performance with a power
   conversion efficiency of 11.5\%.},

Abstract = {Colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs) are attractive for solution-processed
   thin-film optoelectronic applications. In particular, directly achieving
   QD thin-films by printing is a very promising method for low-cost and
   large-scale fabrication. The kinetics of QD particles during the
   deposition process play an important role in the QD film quality and
   their respective optoelectronic performance. In this work, the particle
   self-organization behavior of small-sized QDs with an average diameter
   of 2.88 +/- 0.36 nm is investigated for the first time in situ during
   printing by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The
   time-dependent changes in peak intensities suggest that the structure
   formation and phase transition of QD films happen within 30 seconds. The
   stacking of QDs is initialized by a templating effect, and a
   face-centered cubic (FCC) film forms in which a superlattice distortion
   is also found. A body-centered cubic nested FCC stacking is the final QD
   assembly layout. The small size of the inorganic QDs and the ligand
   collapse during the solvent evaporation can well explain this stacking
   behavior. These results provide important fundamental understanding of
   structure formation of small-sized QD based films prepared via
   large-scale deposition with printing with a slot die coater.},

Abstract = {Perovskite materials serve as promising candidates for display and
   lighting due to their excellent optical properties, including tunable
   bandgaps and efficient luminescence. However, their efficiency and
   stability must be improved for further application. In this work,
   quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites embedded in different
   polymers are prepared by inkjet printing to construct any luminescent
   patterns/pictures on the polymer substrates. The optimized quantum yield
   reaches over 65\% by polyvinyl-chloride-based quasi-2D perovskite
   composites. In addition, as-fabricated perovskite-polymer composites
   with patterns show excellent resistance to abrasion, moisture, light
   irradiation, and chemical erosion by various solvents. Both quantum
   yield and lifetime are superior to those reported to date. These
   achievements are attributed to the introduction of the PEA(+) cations to
   improve the luminance and stability of perovskite. This patterned
   composite can be useful for color-conversion films with low cost and
   large-scale fabrication.},

Abstract = {Smart contact lenses have been put forward for years, but there is still
   no commercial product in the market; the high cost due to expensive
   fabrication techniques could be one of the reasons. In this paper,
   first, a cost-efficient and reliable route to fabricate graphene grating
   on contact lens was designed and demonstrated based on the direct laser
   interference patterning graphene film on commercial contact lenses using
   an Nd:YAG laser. The thickness of the film and the interference angle
   have been taken into consideration. Optical characterization and
   simulation have been applied to evaluate the quality of our final
   achieved grating patterns with a grating size from 0.92 to 3.04 mu m.
   Two-dimensional (2D) patterns could also be obtained through double-time
   laser interference. Contact angles for samples with different
   interference angles were presented considering the service environment
   of smart contact lenses. Of course, the conductivity of the samples was
   evaluated using a four-probe method. The most conductive sample had the
   sheet resistance lower than 30 Omega/sq. This research study highlighted
   the possibility of patterning graphene with the laser ablation method
   and provided a candidate solution for the fabrication of smart contact
   lenses under controlled cost.},

Abstract = {All-solution-processed quantum dot (QD) upconversion devices were
   realized by constructing a colloidal PbS QD near-infrared (NIR similar
   to 1 mu m)-sensitive layer on the cathode side of a red CdSe quantum dot
   light-emitting diode (QLED). Different from conventional upconversion
   devices, we utilized the photogenerated electrons rather than the holes
   created in the NIR-sensitive layer to inject into the QLED for visible
   light emission. Consequently, we obtained high-performance devices with
   a maximum photon-to-photon conversion efficiency of 3.35\% and a
   luminance on-off ratio of approximately 8 x 10(3). The results indicate
   that the device structure could be used to realize low-cost and portable
   high-performance QD-based upconversion devices via solution-processing.

Abstract = {Recently, lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) have demonstrated great
   potential in becoming one of the most promising next-generation
   photoelectrical materials for photodetectors. PbS QDs provide
   fascinating properties including size-controllable spectral sensitivity,
   a wide and tunable absorption range, cost-efficient solution
   processability, and flexible substrate compatibility. One of the key
   problems that limit the performance of PbS QDs-based photodetectors is
   inefficient carrier transfer. Long ligands decorating the outside
   surface of PbS QDs to protect them against degeneration inhibit the
   transfer of electrical charge carriers and thereby limit the device
   performance. To overcome this problem, the long ligands need to be
   effectively exchanged. Here, a two-step ligand-exchange method is
   demonstrated. The QDs are pretreated using methylammonium iodide in
   solution as the first step ligand exchange before the layer-by-layer
   deposition process and solid-state ligand exchange. The
   grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy analyses prove a smaller spacing among the QDs and an
   increased ligand-exchange ratio by adopting the two-step method. This
   strongly indicates a better capability of charge transfer than the
   traditional one-step solid-state ligand-exchange technology. Devices
   fabricated using the two-step method present an enhancement of the
   charge-transfer capability with a larger current. The efficient charge
   transfer is further demonstrated by a significant 94\% increase of the
   responsivity and a 57\% enhancement of the detectivity of the PbS
   QDs-based photodetector, reaching 3302 mA/W and 5.06 x 10(12) J,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Chip-scale package (CSP) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are considered as
   the next generation of highly efficient package LED. However, they
   suffer from total internal reflection that limits their light extraction
   efficiency (LEE). In this letter, surface patterning, in terms of
   microstructures, as a well-controlled surface roughness method is
   designed and applied on CSP-LED to improve the LEE. Based on simulation
   results, pyramid and flat top pyramid structures have been designed and
   optimized. Four types of layouts, including tightly, interlaced, distant
   and chessboard layout, are also compared. A LEE enhancement of more than
   20\% is achieved. Furthermore, the four layouts with pyramid structures
   are fabricated using nanoimprint technology. The experimental results
   match the simulated results well with only a mismatch of 2.9\%. The
   fabricated layout shows an enhancement of 20.31\% when pyramid
   structures are fully filling the surface. Surface patterned CSP-LED,
   therefore, exhibits a great potential for high efficient LED.},

   sources in VLC, conventional white light emitting diode (WLED) based on
   Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce) phosphor limits the system transmitting rate
   severely due to its narrow modulation bandwidth. Considering the short
   fluorescent lifetime of quantum dots (QDs), QD-LEDs with wide modulation
   bandwidths were designed here to improve the transmitting rate of VLC.
   CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs and related luminescent microspheres (LMS) were
   implemented as light conversion materials for the QD-LEDs. Compared with
   conventional phosphor WLED, the proposed QD-LED and QD-WLED reached
   maximum improvement on modulation bandwidth at 74.19\% and 67.75\%
   respectively. Furthermore, mathematical modeling of smearing was
   analyzed to establish the relationship between fluorescent lifetime and
   modulation bandwidth. Our findings will provide an effective solution of
   white LEDs for high speed VLC. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America},

Abstract = {Surface patterning, in terms of microstructure, as a precise surface
   roughness method for chip scale package (CSP) LED, will enormously
   improve the light extraction efficiency (LEE) with much less total
   internal reflection loss. In this paper, several kinds of
   microstructures and layouts have been designed and optimized by using
   the Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulation method. During the simulation, an
   accurate CSP-LED model is built Shape, size, separation and arrangement
   of the microstructures are taken into consideration to find out how much
   the above parameters affect the LEE. LEE Enhancement of more than 20\%
   is achieved by several structures compared to CSP-LED without surface
   patterning. Among which, enhancement of 20.90\% is reached utilizing 5x5
   pyramid arrays with a gradient of 54.7 degrees. Furthermore, each
   designed microstructure is also fabricated through the nano-imprint
   technology. Experimental results prove the feasibility of former designs
   and 20.31\% enhancement of LEE is achieved.},
