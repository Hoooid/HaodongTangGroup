Recently, the INTERNATIONAL NANO-OPTOELECTRONICS WORKSHOP (INOW 2024) was successfully held at Shenzhen Technology University (SZTU). The event attracted numerous experts and scholars from around the world to discuss cutting-edge technologies and applications in the field of nano-optoelectronics. Professor Xiao Wei Sun, President of the MiLEDA Alliance and Executive Dean of the Institute of Nanoscience and Applications at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), was invited to attend and toured the College of Integrated Circuits and Optoelectronic Chips at SZTU.

Professor Sun has long been committed to nurturing high-quality scientific and technological talent. Under his mentorship, many students and teachers from his research group now hold faculty positions at SZTU's School of New Materials and New Energy, School of Engineering Physics, and the College of Integrated Circuits and Optoelectronic Chips. Professor Sun expressed his pride in the excellent performance of his students at SZTU, noting that technological innovation is inseparable from high-quality talent cultivation. He also emphasized his ongoing dedication to training more outstanding students to contribute to the development of the country and society.

To date, Professor Sun has mentored over 50 PhD students specializing in flat-panel display technology at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and at SUSTech. Additionally, he has offered highly regarded courses for both undergraduate and graduate students, such as Organic Electronics, Fundamentals of Optoelectronics Technology, Glasses-Free 3D Displays, and Thin Film Materials and Technology, with a course satisfaction rate of over 90%. In recognition of his continuous contributions to student training and professional development in the flat-panel display industry in China and Southeast Asia, Professor Sun was awarded the 2023 SID Slottow-Owaki Award.

Our research group, led by Professor Haodong Tang, warmly welcomed Professor Sunâ€™s visit! We look forward to more collaboration and exchanges with his team to further advance nano-optoelectronics technologies.
