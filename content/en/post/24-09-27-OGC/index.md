A huge congratulations to Lei Rao, an undergraduate from Professor Tang Haodong's team at the School of Integrated Circuits and Optoelectronic Chips, for winning the prestigious 2024 Best Poster Award at the 9th IEEE Optoelectronics Global Conference (IEEE OGC 2024) held in Shenzhen, China!

Lei’s poster, titled Efficient SWIR PbS QD Photodetector Based on A Hot Spin-coating Method, showcased groundbreaking advancements in photodetector technology. This innovative research uses a novel hot spin-coating method to develop high-performance shortwave infrared (SWIR) lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dot photodetectors, a major step forward in device fabrication and performance. By controlling the solvent evaporation rate during spin-coating through substrate heating, this technique yields remarkably uniform films and improved detector performance, setting new standards in dark current, photocurrent, and response time.

Special thanks to Assistant Professor Tang Haodong and Associate Professor Chen Wei, who guided this successful project, and congratulations once again to Lei for this outstanding achievement and well-deserved recognition at such a prominent international conference! Keep up the fantastic work! 🌟👏
