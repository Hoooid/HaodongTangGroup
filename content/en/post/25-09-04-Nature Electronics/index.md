🎉 Nature Electronics | Toward Standardization of EQE Testing for Emerging Photodetectors


<!--more-->
We are excited to share that the research team led by Haodong Tang and Wei Chen at Shenzhen Technology University has published a Comment article in Nature Electronics, entitled:
📝 “Time to standardize external quantum efficiency testing of emerging photodetectors”
🔗 DOI: 10.1038/s41928-025-01446-7

🔍 Background

Emerging photodetectors based on quantum dots, perovskites, and other novel semiconductors are rapidly advancing. Yet, differences in:
💡 Light sources,
⚖️ Power & photon flux calibration,
📐 Illumination geometry, and
📊 Readout conditions (bias, bandwidth, filtering)
have made EQE testing inconsistent across labs, limiting comparability and reproducibility.

🚀 Key Contributions

This article does not aim to report “higher EQE values,” but instead proposes a standardized testing framework to ensure transparent, reproducible, and comparable results:

✅ Linear response validation – Confirm the device operates in a linear power–response regime before EQE is measured.
🔄 Methodological clarity – Clearly distinguish between the direct method (calibrated photon flux + photocurrent) and the indirect method (responsivity-based), and state their assumptions.
📑 Uncertainty reporting – Provide uncertainty budgets and encourage cross-validation between teams.

Figures in the article illustrate:

📈 Linear vs. nonlinear response regimes (showing when EQE is valid).
🔦 Direct vs. indirect methods and how results vary depending on light sources and calibration.

🌐 Significance

The message is clear:
✨ Progress in EQE research lies not in bigger numbers, but in establishing a unified, physics-grounded measurement protocol.

By defining minimum reporting standards and improving method transparency, this work lays the foundation for reliable, comparable, and reproducible evaluation of next-generation photodetectors.

👉 Congratulations to the team for this impactful contribution that strengthens the foundations of emerging optoelectronics! 🎉
