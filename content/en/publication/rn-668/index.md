abstract: Quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) possess huge potential in display
  due to their outstanding optoelectronic performance; however, serve degradation
  during operation blocks their practical applications. High temperature is regarded
  as one of major factors causing degradation. Therefore, a systematical study on
  the working temperature of QLEDs is very essential and urgent for the development
  of high stable QLEDs. In this work, different influence factors such as the electro-optic
  conversion efficiency (EOCE), voltage, current density, active area, substrate size,
  substrate type and sample contact are discussed in detail on the working temperature
  of QLEDs. The research results show that the working temperature of general QLEDs
  under normal operation conditions is usually smaller than 75 degrees C when the
  ambient temperature is 25 degrees C. However, temperature of QLEDs working under
  extreme conditions, such as high power or small substrate size, will exceed 100
  degrees C, resulting in irreversible damage to the devices. Moreover, some effective
  measures to reduce the working temperature are also proposed. The analysis and discussion
  of various influencing factors in this work will provide guidance for the design
  of stable QLEDs and help them work at a safer temperature.
