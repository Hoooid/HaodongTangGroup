abstract: Smart contact lenses have been put forward for years, but there is still
  no commercial product in the market; the high cost due to expensive fabrication
  techniques could be one of the reasons. In this paper, first, a cost-efficient and
  reliable route to fabricate graphene grating on contact lens was designed and demonstrated
  based on the direct laser interference patterning graphene film on commercial contact
  lenses using an Nd:YAG laser. The thickness of the film and the interference angle
  have been taken into consideration. Optical characterization and simulation have
  been applied to evaluate the quality of our final achieved grating patterns with
  a grating size from 0.92 to 3.04 mum. Two-dimensional (2D) patterns could also be
  obtained through double-time laser interference. Contact angles for samples with
  different interference angles were presented considering the service environment
  of smart contact lenses. Of course, the conductivity of the samples was evaluated
  using a four-probe method. The most conductive sample had the sheet resistance lower
  than 30 Omega/sq. This research study highlighted the possibility of patterning
  graphene with the laser ablation method and provided a candidate solution for the
  fabrication of smart contact lenses under controlled cost.
