abstract: Colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs) are attractive for solution-processed thin-film
  optoelectronic applications. In particular, directly achieving QD thin-films by
  printing is a very promising method for low-cost and large-scale fabrication. The
  kinetics of QD particles during the deposition process play an important role in
  the QD film quality and their respective optoelectronic performance. In this work,
  the particle self-organization behavior of small-sized QDs with an average diameter
  of 2.88 +/- 0.36 nm is investigated for the first time in situ during printing by
  grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The time-dependent changes
  in peak intensities suggest that the structure formation and phase transition of
  QD films happen within 30 seconds. The stacking of QDs is initialized by a templating
  effect, and a face-centered cubic (FCC) film forms in which a superlattice distortion
  is also found. A body-centered cubic nested FCC stacking is the final QD assembly
  layout. The small size of the inorganic QDs and the ligand collapse during the solvent
  evaporation can well explain this stacking behavior. These results provide important
  fundamental understanding of structure formation of small-sized QD based films prepared
  via large-scale deposition with printing with a slot die coater.
