Jun Tang is an Assistant Professor and a recipient of the "Peacock Plan" Category C talent in Shenzhen. He graduated with a PhD from Peking University in July 2020, where he focused on the research of novel energy storage materials and devices. During his PhD, he received the National CSC Scholarship for a joint training program at Drexel University, USA, to develop applications of new two-dimensional transition metal carbides/nitrides in energy storage. After his PhD, he joined the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology as a postdoctoral researcher. He has published over ten papers as the first author in top-tier journals like Adv. Energy Mater., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., Energy Storage Mater., and J. Mater. Chem. A, and holds three national patents (as of July 2022).
