abstract: Recently, lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) have demonstrated great
  potential in becoming one of the most promising next-generation photoelectrical
  materials for photodetectors. PbS QDs provide fascinating properties including size-controllable
  spectral sensitivity, a wide and tunable absorption range, cost-efficient solution
  processability, and flexible substrate compatibility. One of the key problems that
  limit the performance of PbS QDs-based photodetectors is inefficient carrier transfer.
  Long ligands decorating the outside surface of PbS QDs to protect them against degeneration
  inhibit the transfer of electrical charge carriers and thereby limit the device
  performance. To overcome this problem, the long ligands need to be effectively exchanged.
  Here, a two-step ligand-exchange method is demonstrated. The QDs are pretreated
  using methylammonium iodide in solution as the first step ligand exchange before
  the layer-by-layer deposition process and solid-state ligand exchange. The grazing-incidence
  small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses prove
  a smaller spacing among the QDs and an increased ligand-exchange ratio by adopting
  the two-step method. This strongly indicates a better capability of charge transfer
  than the traditional one-step solid-state ligand-exchange technology. Devices fabricated
  using the two-step method present an enhancement of the charge-transfer capability
  with a larger current. The efficient charge transfer is further demonstrated by
  a significant 94% increase of the responsivity and a 57% enhancement of the detectivity
  of the PbS QDs-based photodetector, reaching 3302 mA/W and 5.06 x 10(12) J, respectively.
