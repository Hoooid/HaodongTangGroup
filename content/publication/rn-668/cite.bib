 abstract = {Quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) possess huge potential in display due to their outstanding optoelectronic performance; however, serve degradation during operation blocks their practical applications. High temperature is regarded as one of major factors causing degradation. Therefore, a systematical study on the working temperature of QLEDs is very essential and urgent for the development of high stable QLEDs. In this work, different influence factors such as the electro-optic conversion efficiency (EOCE), voltage, current density, active area, substrate size, substrate type and sample contact are discussed in detail on the working temperature of QLEDs. The research results show that the working temperature of general QLEDs under normal operation conditions is usually smaller than 75 degrees C when the ambient temperature is 25 degrees C. However, temperature of QLEDs working under extreme conditions, such as high power or small substrate size, will exceed 100 degrees C, resulting in irreversible damage to the devices. Moreover, some effective measures to reduce the working temperature are also proposed. The analysis and discussion of various influencing factors in this work will provide guidance for the design of stable QLEDs and help them work at a safer temperature.},
