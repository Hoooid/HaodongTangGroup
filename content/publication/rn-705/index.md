abstract: PbS quantum dot (QD) solar cells demonstrate great potential in solar energy
  conversion with a broad and flexible spectral response. Even though long-term storage
  stabilities of QD solar cells were reported in literature, the operation stability
  from a more practical aspect, to date, has been not yet investigated. Herein, we
  observe the structure degradation process of a PbS QD-ink based solar cell during
  the device operation. Simultaneously to probing the solar cell parameters, the overall
  structure evolutions of the QDs in both, active layer and hole transport layer of
  the solar cell are studied with grazing-incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering
  (GISAXS/GIWAXS). We find a spontaneous decrease of the QD inter-dot distance with
  an increase in the spatial disorder in the active layer (PbX2-PbS QDs, X = I, and
  Br) during the operation induced degradation. Consequently, the structure disorder-induced
  broadening of the energy state distribution is responsible for the decrease in open-circuit
  voltage V-oc leading to the device degradation. These findings elucidate the origin
  of light-soaking as well as the structure degradation of QD ink-based solar cells
  and indicate that the stability of the device can be realized by the positional
  stabilization of the QDs in the QD solid.
