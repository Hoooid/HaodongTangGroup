abstract: For PbS quantum dot (QD)-based optoelectronic devices, gold is the most
  frequently used electrode material. In most device architectures, gold is in direct
  contact with the QD solid. To better understand the formation of the interface between
  gold and a close-packed QD layer at an early stage, in situ grazing-incidence small-angle
  X-ray scattering is used to observe the gold sputter deposition on a 1,2-ethanedithiol
  (EDT)-treated PbS QD solid. In the kinetics of gold layer growth, the forming and
  merging of small gold clusters (radius less than 1.6 nm) are observed at the early
  stages. The thereby formed medium gold clusters (radius between 1.9-2.4 nm) are
  influenced by the QDs' templating effect. Furthermore, simulations suggest that
  the medium gold clusters grow preferably along the QDs' boundaries rather than as
  a top coating of the QDs. When the thickness of the sputtered gold layer reaches
  6.25 nm, larger gold clusters with a radius of 5.3 nm form. Simultaneously, a percolation
  layer with a thickness of 2.5 nm is established underneath the gold clusters. This
  fundamental understanding of the QD-gold interface formation will help to control
  the implementation of sputtered gold electrodes on close-packed QD solids in device
  manufacturing processes.
