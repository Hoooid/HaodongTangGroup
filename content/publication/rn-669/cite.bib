 abstract = {For PbS quantum dot (QD)-based optoelectronic devices, gold is the most frequently used electrode material. In most device architectures, gold is in direct contact with the QD solid. To better understand the formation of the interface between gold and a close-packed QD layer at an early stage, in situ grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering is used to observe the gold sputter deposition on a 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT)-treated PbS QD solid. In the kinetics of gold layer growth, the forming and merging of small gold clusters (radius less than 1.6 nm) are observed at the early stages. The thereby formed medium gold clusters (radius between 1.9-2.4 nm) are influenced by the QDs' templating effect. Furthermore, simulations suggest that the medium gold clusters grow preferably along the QDs' boundaries rather than as a top coating of the QDs. When the thickness of the sputtered gold layer reaches 6.25 nm, larger gold clusters with a radius of 5.3 nm form. Simultaneously, a percolation layer with a thickness of 2.5 nm is established underneath the gold clusters. This fundamental understanding of the QD-gold interface formation will help to control the implementation of sputtered gold electrodes on close-packed QD solids in device manufacturing processes.},
