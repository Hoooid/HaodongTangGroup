abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) have received considerable attention in information displays
  owing to their high quantum yield, high colour purity and low-cost fabrication.
  However, light emission for ultra-thin QD films with low mass percentage of QDs
  still need to be improved because the blue light can directly transmit the films,
  leading to insufficient energy to excite the QDs. In this study, we report QD films
  based on a poly(zinc methacrylate) coating with alloyed green-emitting CdZnSeS/ZnS
  quantum dots (QDs@PZnMA) together with high refractive-index BaTiO(3) nanoparticles
  to enhance the scattering coefficient of the QD films. Results demonstrate a 7.5-fold
  increase in the absorption coefficient, 11.3-fold increase in the scattering coefficient,
  8.5-fold increase in the optical density (OD) and 8.6-fold increase in the green-light
  emission of QD films, compared with films that have the same mass percentage of
  pristine QDs. This approach provides a promising strategy for developing QD optical
  films with high scattering and enhanced light emission for flexible displays.
