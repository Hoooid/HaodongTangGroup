abstract: Improving the stability of inkjet-printed quantum dot light emitting diodes
  (QLEDs) is critical for the technology to become commercially viable. The major
  obstacle is the compromise between the printability of the ink system and the functionality
  of the carrier transport layers. Here, a ternary ink system consisting of octane,
  1-cyclohexyl-ethanol, and n-butyl acetate is reported, which solves the erosion
  between the printed quantum dot ink and the underneath hole transport layer. A gradient
  vacuum post-treatment is developed to accompany the ternary ink system with gradient
  vacuum pressures, which is helpful in forming a uniform printing layer. Based on
  both technologies, the inkjet-printed R/G/B QLEDS are fabricated with high resolution
  patterns, showing high efficiencies and stabilities. The external quantum efficiency
  of R/G/B devices is 19.3%, 18.0%, and 4.4%, respectively. Correspondingly, the half
  operating lifetime is up to 25 178 h @ 1000 cd m(-2), 20 655 h @ 1000 cd m(-2),
  and 46 h @ 100 cd m(-2), respectively. The improvements in the ink engineering and
  post-treatment in this study have taken the efficiency and stability of the devices
  to a higher level and confirm the application prospects of printed QLEDs in the
  display industry.
