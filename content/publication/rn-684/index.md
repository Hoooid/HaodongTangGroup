abstract: The high open-circuit voltage (V(oc) ) loss arising from insufficient surface
  passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current lead sulfide
  colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) solar cell. Here, synergistic passivation is performed
  in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional
  ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically
  optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to
  the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower surface trap density and
  beneficial doping behavior compared to the control sample. The obtained CQD inks
  show the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24% for all photovoltaic
  PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of approximately
  10%. As a result, a high V(oc) of 0.71 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of
  13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest V(oc) loss (0.35 eV) for the reported
  PbS CQD solar cells with PCE >10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells.
  This work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies
  and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct-synthesis protocol of PbS
  CQDs.
