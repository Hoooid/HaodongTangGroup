abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) is an advanced and high-efficiency wireless
  communication technology. As one of the most important light sources in VLC, conventional
  white light emitting diode (WLED) based on Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG:Ce) phosphor limits
  the system transmitting rate severely due to its narrow modulation bandwidth. Considering
  the short fluorescent lifetime of quantum dots (QDs), QD-LEDs with wide modulation
  bandwidths were designed here to improve the transmitting rate of VLC. CdSe/ZnS
  core/shell QDs and related luminescent microspheres (LMS) were implemented as light
  conversion materials for the QD-LEDs. Compared with conventional phosphor WLED,
  the proposed QD-LED and QD-WLED reached maximum improvement on modulation bandwidth
  at 74.19% and 67.75% respectively. Furthermore, mathematical modeling of smearing
  was analyzed to establish the relationship between fluorescent lifetime and modulation
  bandwidth. Our findings will provide an effective solution of white LEDs for high
  speed VLC. 2016 Optical Society of America.
