abstract: The emergence of optical Internet of Things (optical-IoT) for sixth-generation
  (6G) networks has been envisaged to relieve the bandwidth congestion in the conventional
  radio frequency (RF) channel, and to support the ever-increasing number of smart
  devices. Among the plethora of device innovations deemed essential for fortifying
  the development, herein we report on the visible-to-near-infrared color-conversion
  luminescent-dyes based on lead sulphide quantum dots (PbS QDs), so as to achieve
  an eye-safe high-speed optical link. The solution-processed PbS QDs exhibited strong
  absorption in the visible range, radiative recombination lifetime of 6.4 $μ$s, as
  well as high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 88%. Our proof-of-principle
  demonstration based on an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation
  scheme established an infrared data transmission of 0.27 Mbit/s, readily supporting
  an indoor optical-IoT system, and shed light on the possibility for PbS-integrated
  transceivers in supporting remote access control of multiple nodes. We further envisaged
  that our investigations could find applications in future development of solution-processable
  PbS-integrated luminescent fibers, concentrators, and waveguides for high-speed
  optical receivers.
